/*
Notice how the production database configuration has different keys
than the development configuration? When you deploy your application
to production, your database will be read from a URL path instead of
a local database file. You will also be using PostgresQL in production
rather than SQLite3 as a SQL database management system. Recall that
SQLite3 is supposed to be used ONLY in development. PostgresQL is a
production-level database management system.
